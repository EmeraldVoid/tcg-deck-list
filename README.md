# TCG Decklists Repository  

This repository and website were created for viewers of my [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/emerald_void) to easily access the decklists I use for various card games.  

**Note:** Some of the listed decks are not ones I have built yet but are either decks I am looking to build or theorycraft lists.
